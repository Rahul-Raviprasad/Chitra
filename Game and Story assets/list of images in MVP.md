Few Scenes to perhaps include

Scene 1: chitra meets arjuna during training.
Chitra learns a few archery skills from a stranger in the forest. She aims at a target and does well. Seeing this
Arjuna is impressed. He approaches her when she is about to take her next shot.
He tells her she is taking too long to fire.

At first she doesn't take him seriously, and asks" how am I supposed to aim?"
"you are not, your eyes have already aimed" and he pick up the bow and before she can say a
single word arjuna fires 3 arrow all hitting bulls eye

she just stands there with mouth opened in astonishment. and realized that the person in front
of her is no ordinary man.
