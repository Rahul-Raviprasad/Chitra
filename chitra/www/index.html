  		<p>Story starts with introduction to Chitrangada:

      Chitrangada (Chitra)the warrior Princess, is the daughter of the King of Manipur. Their family was

      blessed with Lord Shiva’s grace of male descendents for over generations. Chitra being the only heir to

      her father was brought up as a son.

      Chitra grows up amoung swords and spears with strong hands that can bend a bow, but had no feminine

      wiles to win hearts with Cupid’s archery.

      Narrate how Chitra is restless and Madan and Vasanta approach her

      Once, Vasanta (the Lord of Youth) and Madana (Lord of Love) ask Chitra who she is and what has been

      bothering her. She narrates her encounter with Arjuna where she elaborates:

      She once went to the deep forest thickets for a game of hunting along the Puma river, where she saw a

      man lying on a bed of dried leaves across her path. She tried asking him who he was and why was he

      lying on the ground, but he didn’t answer. Chitra pricked him with the point of her arrow, with which he

      stood of straight upon his feet. Seeing her boyish attire (countenance), a smile flickered on his face. For

      the first time Chitra felt like a woman standing before a man. She asked him who he was, to which he

      answered “I am Arjuna, of the great Kuru clan”. Chitra was spellbound, it was the same Arjuna, the idol

      of her dreams who vowed for a twelve year celibacy. With whom she had an ambition to challenge for a

      single combat and prove her skills against him. (we can introduce Arjuna as a character here)

      Lost in the pool of her thoughts, Chitra came to reality only to realise that Arjuna has vanished in the

      forest without a word. She cursed her foolishness to not greet, or speak or ask for forgiveness.

      The next morning, Chitra laid aside her man’s clothing and wore anklets, bracelets and a purple red

      gown which embraced her unpleasing body. She fled on her quest to find Arjuna in the forest temple of

      Lord Shiva.

      Checkpoint: She speaks to Arjuna or she comes back to the palace without a word to him

      She approached Arjuna and confronted her desires. But Arjuna turned her down speaking of his vows of

      celibacy. (her Narration ends, back to story)

      Checkpoint: what does Chitra wish for? 1) Impress him with Beauty, 2)Cast a Spell on him? Or…(more

      can be added)

      Chitra cursed her herself and begged to Madana saying “the pride of my manlike strength is in vain, all

      my man’s training is crushed at your feet. O Lord teach me the art of Love, the power of the weak and

      weapon of the unarmed hand. Give me one single day of perfect beauty to win over Arjuna and have

      one night of love with him.

      Moved by her plea, Madana and Vasanta granted her wish not for a short span of a day, but for an

      entire year with him.

      Later during the day, Arjuna sees a beautiful lady(Chitra as a woman) by the lake in the forest and

      marvels at the true form of beauty he has ever seen. Taken by the utter beauty before his eyes, he

      strikes a conversation with her and requests to know what is it that she’s searching. Chitra says that she

      harbors a desire and pleads for its fulfillment daily to Lord Shiva. She searched for the famed son of the

      Kurus - Arjuna, the conqueror of the world, the one who vowed for 12 year celibacy. Smitten by her

      mere presence, Arjuna prompts that he would no longer abide by his vows. Even if this makes her

      happy, Chitra somewhere is heart-broken to realize that Arjuna is in love with a disguise, not with her

      true self and asks him to not offer his heart to an illusion.

      But Arjuna’s enticing gaze and his praises for her beauty haunt Chitra to make her forget her past life

      and her former existence.

      Checkpoint: 1)Chitra chooses to stay with Arjuna that night, 2) Chitra fleds off to her Palace to turn

      back the spell, 3)Chitra tells him about her true self.

      Lost to their passion and their hearts desires they spend a night together of unequalled ecstasy (Lost to

      their passion, they gratified their hearts desires in an ecstatic union of life).

      The next day, Chitra admits to Madana and Vasanta, to escape away from Arjuna realizing that its an

      illusion that Arjuna has fallen for and not her. She sees the beauty different from her true self and does

      not wish to continue the torturous encounter with Arjuna again.

      Lord Madana and Vasanta remind her, that it is this, that she had asked for. They assure her that by the

      end of the year, Arjuna would realize her true self and would embrace her as the true Chitra.

      Checkpoint: 1)Chitra chooses to meet Arjuna in the same form anyway, 2) CHitra withdraws and

      requests to take back the spell, 3) Chitra tells Arjuna of her true self.

      Throughout the year, she spends her time with Arjuna giving him no clue of her past, her family or her

      relatives thinking that he would forget her and leave her by the end of the year. Soon (Intrigued)Arjuna

      grows restless to realize that Chitra has been secretive about her existence and her family and regards

      herself as a transient short lived illusion.

      The year is at its end and Chitra pleads for the last night to be the most beautiful with him. During the

      same time, Arjuna hears the Villagers to be troubled of the robbers from the Northern hills. They speak

      of Chitra the mighty warrior princess who was a terror to all the evil doers. But she has gone for a

      pilgrimage, and no one knows how to find her, for only she can bring peace to her people.

      Startled with the greatness of warden of the province- a woman, Arjuna grows curious to know more

      her and even inquires about her to Chitra herself. Never having told her name to Arjuna, Chitra tells him

      that the warrior Princess isn’t as beautiful. She assures that the villagers would take care of the

      robberies, and he need not worry. Arjuna denies to enjoy his last night with her and admits to be

      distracted with the Princess’ thoughts and has been eager to learn about her.

      Checkpoint: 1) Chitra chooses to confront, 2) She feels disheartened and leaves to her Palace without

      a word., 3) Convinces Arjuna that Chitra isn’t as desirable.

      Chitra asks him bitterly “ tell me if now at once, by some magic, I shake myself from this voluptuous

      being, to stand up straight with the strength of a daring heart, would I appeal to a man?” Confused by

      her question, Arjuna requests her to unveil herself for he couldn’t really love her as much as he wished

      and feels his love is incomplete.

      Chitra finally unveils her true self, in the clothes of a man, standing up with all her strength and might.

      She admits that she isn’t as beautiful as the illusion, but would stay with Arjuna for forever if he accepts

      her. She reveals that she carries his baby in her womb. Arjuna is pleased with the revelation and marries

      her rendering his life to be truly complete.</p>
